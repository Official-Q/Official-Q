- 👋 Hi, I’m @Official-Q, former avionics technician on two different air frames, and 5 different sub-models. Familiar with _electronics,_ but not coding.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning (first and foremost how to even use this website!) coding basics, and anything that can help me with music production app design. And by basics, I MEAN. BASICS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything and everything I can! Despite my background in avionics, I'm not all that tech savvy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Future projects, maybe?
- 📫 How to reach me ... Well, can't you message others right here on Github? If not, I'll have to come back and edit this...
